# Provider Delegation

The Lava Foundation will hold a Provider Delegation program to bootstrap RPC providers on Lava Network and improve overall quality of service across the network. Providers offer RPC services, but in the future, the network will serve many other types of infrastructure such as indexing and oracles.

Any community provider can apply to be delegated. A submission form will be available soon. 

### Guidelines

- Delegations on incentivized chains ([learn more](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog/helping-rollups-and-blockchains-scale-with-incentivized-public-rpc)) are capped to 1/2 of the Provider organic stake (total stake not delegated by the Foundation)
- Delegations on bootstrapped chains do not require any self stake (only the minimum stake amount)
- Commission set at 70% or lower
- Delegation limit must not be reached (meaning it is higher than the delegation amount + any organic delegation - it is recommended to take a big buffer)
