# Lava Delegation Policy Overview

:::info The next round of Foundation delegations toward Active Set Validators will open in October
:::

## Objective

Lava is committed to maintaining a robust and dynamic validator ecosystem. We initiate with a fully active set and plan to implement an ongoing delegation program. This program will evaluate and potentially rotate validators quarterly based on demand and performance metrics. This approach allows new validators the opportunity to join and contribute to the network, replacing others as needed to optimize network performance and engagement.

## Initial Active Set Criteria for Delegation

Delegation decisions are based on a variety of factors to ensure a diverse and effective validator set:

- Validator experience and historical performance on select Cosmos chains.
- Demonstrated potential for contributions to our mainnet.
- Active community engagement and support.
- Marketing contributions that can enhance Lavaâ€™s visibility.
- Participation in Lava testnets, both as validators and service providers.

## Process for Validators to Get Delegation

Potential validators can apply every quarter. Dedicated announcements about the delegation program, along with its criteria, will be published when the time comes.

1. Validators must set up their operations on the mainnet ahead of applying (they do not have to be in the active set).
2. Validator setups are evaluated based on their marketing, technical setup, and contributions to Lava and other networks.
3. Contributions are scored, and validators are classified into tiers (1-4), determining their delegation amounts.
4. Validators are informed of the expected contributions (per the application submitted by them).
5. Contribution verification is conducted to ensure operational standards.
6. Upon successful verification, delegations are finalized.

## Dynamic Delegation Adjustments

Validators are evaluated each quarter:

- Validators failing to meet the established benchmarks may be cycled out in favor of new entrants.
- This regular assessment ensures that Lava's validator community remains vibrant, effective, and aligned with the evolving demands of the network.

## Scoring and Tiers

Without disclosing the precise scoring mechanism, validators are assessed on a broad spectrum of activities ranging from marketing influence and technical performance to community and network contributions. Scores help classify validators into four tiers, influencing their delegation scale. Tiers range from 1 to 4, with higher tiers receiving larger delegations based on their broader impact and contributions to the network.

## Special Considerations for Commercial Partners

Some commercial partners, such as web infrastructure or analytical service providers, are engaged differently. These partners may not fit into the standard tier system as their delegations are tailored to the specific services and value they provide to the network.

## Conclusion

Lava aims to foster a transparent, fair, and competitive environment for all validators, ensuring the long-term security and efficiency of the network. Regular updates and adjustments to the delegation policy will be communicated to all stakeholders to maintain transparency and engagement across the Lava ecosystem.
